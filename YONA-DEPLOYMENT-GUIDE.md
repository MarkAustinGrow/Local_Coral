# Verify Python and dependencies
python --version
python -c "import langchain; print('LangChain OK')"
python -c "import requests; print('Requests OK')"

# Check environment file exists
ls -la .env
```

### **🔹 Step 3: Start Yona Agent**

## 🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS

### **✅ Connection Test**

Once Yona is running, test the system by going to coral.pushcollective.club and making a music request:

**Test Query**: "Please create a song about ocean waves"

**Expected Flow**:
1. Interface Agent receives request
2. Creates thread with Yona participation  
3. Yona receives mention and processes with AI
4. Song creation workflow begins
5. Real music generated and stored
6. Response delivered with audio URL

### **✅ Success Indicators**

- ✅ **No connection errors** to coral.pushcollective.club:5555
- ✅ **Agent registration** successful
- ✅ **Tools loaded** without errors
- ✅ **Waiting for mentions** (not continuous OpenAI calls)
- ✅ **Music creation** works end-to-end when tested

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue**: Connection refused errors
**Solution**: Verify coral.pushcollective.club:5555 is accessible:
```bash
curl -I http://coral.pushcollective.club:5555
```

### **Issue**: API key errors
**Solution**: Verify .env file has all required keys:
```bash
grep -E "(OPENAI_API_KEY|MUSICAPI_KEY|SUPABASE)" .env
```

### **Issue**: Import errors
**Solution**: Reinstall dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
